# Authoring 0.4.1 — context-provenance correction

Date: 2026-11-01. Current repository stack: Hub CI 1.1 → Router 1.1 → Architecture/Catalog 1.5 → HUB-CAP-AUTHORING ACTIVE/0.4.1. Singleton/five targets and other behavior are unchanged.

## POST-PROMOTION RUNTIME ACTIVATION

Install/replace exact library_modules/HUB-CAP-AUTHORING_v0.4.1.md in Central Hub Config. Verify Module ID, Package ID, CAPABILITY, ACTIVE, Version 0.4.1, FULL_FILE/material body and sufficiently scoped duplicate coverage; no repository fallback or guessed Library IDs. Use exact Router 1.1 pins to HUB_ARCHITECTURE_v1.5.md and HUB_PACKAGE_CATALOG_v1.5.yaml in Project Sources; Hub CI remains 1.1. Do not retain simultaneous root authorities or active Authoring revisions.

User-confirmed actual Central Hub 0.4 results: T1 Author narrow FAIL (invented prior findings), T1 Execution PASS, T2 Rewrite PASS, T2 Reauthor PASS. These replace the earlier NOT_RUN status for the reported 0.4 stages. Codex did not reproduce them and received no full retrieval trace or bound Library object identity. New 0.4.1 installation is NOT_PERFORMED by this task; binding UNRESOLVED / NOT_VERIFIED and live regression NOT_RUN. After installation run only candidates/authoring_v0/AUTHORING_0_4_1_REGRESSION.md. Keep the passed behaviors closed.

## Deliberate correction rollback

Restore the compatible pre-correction Router snapshot, Architecture/Catalog 1.4 and exact Authoring 0.4 from Source_archive/Authoring 0.4.1 correction 2026-11-01/, reverify identities and replace the active authority set deliberately. No automatic fallback. The old module hash is 2b86c680156b78062c2e4e412b1fe30e10002307c0bbd4342850db4a9aa9a317; archive bytes must match. M2 NOT STARTED.

## Historical 0.4 promotion instructions

The following records the preceding promotion, not the current installation target or current live status. Its older NOT_RUN statements are superseded for the user-confirmed 0.4 stages above.

# Prompt Authoring 0.4 — repository promotion and later deployment

Date: 2026-11-01 (Asia/Bangkok). Scope: local repository implementation only.

## Implemented repository topology

```text
Hub CI 1.1 (unchanged)
-> Hub Router 1.1 (algorithm unchanged; exact pins only)
-> Architecture 1.4 / root Catalog 1.4
   -> HUB-PKG-AUTHORING
      -> HUB-CAP-AUTHORING / CAPABILITY / ACTIVE / 0.4
```

The active repository artifact is `library_modules/HUB-CAP-AUTHORING_v0.4.md`. It is a root singleton intended for `ChatGPT Library / Central Hub Config`, with `local_catalog: null`, no hard `requires` and no declared `REFINES` or `COMPLEMENTS`. Target adaptation creates no target dependency.

The root Catalog permits selection only when the first non-empty user-authored line exactly equals one of the five case-sensitive `/AUTHOR <TARGET>` forms with one ASCII space and no surrounding whitespace or extra text. This is Catalog admission metadata, not a second module body or a new Router algorithm.

Repository status after this implementation:

```text
REPOSITORY IMPLEMENTED / STATICALLY VERIFIED
LIBRARY INSTALLATION NOT PERFORMED
LIBRARY BINDING NOT VERIFIED / UNRESOLVED
PROJECT DEPLOYMENT NOT PERFORMED
LIVE ROUTING NOT RUN
```

Prior Hanfu B/C and `/AUTHOR IMAGET` 0.3 results retain their original candidate scope. The user reports T1/T2 were manually injected into a chat outside Central Hub: EXPLORATORY MANUAL-CANDIDATE EVIDENCE only, with no supplied per-stage outputs or results recorded here. MANUAL CANDIDATE INJECTION != CENTRAL HUB RUNTIME VERIFICATION. Neither active acceptance nor demonstrated active runtime failure is established.

## POST-PROMOTION RUNTIME ACTIVATION — not performed

No Authoring Library object is currently established by repository evidence. Inspect the actual Central Hub Config root first: if an exact 0.3 object exists, deliberately replace/retire it; otherwise install 0.4. Do not create two ACTIVE identities. Repository location is not runtime retrieval. The next valid T1/T2 must run in the actual Central Hub under CI 1.1, Router 1.1, Architecture/Catalog 1.4 and verified Authoring 0.4; do not manually inject candidate text into another chat. Use the frozen inputs in candidates/authoring_v0/AUTHORING_0_4_M1_TESTS.md after the checks below, recording new Central Hub results separately.

## Manual deployment sequence — not executed here

1. In `ChatGPT Library / Central Hub Config`, ensure no existing object can create an ambiguous `HUB-CAP-AUTHORING / HUB-PKG-AUTHORING / CAPABILITY / ACTIVE / 0.4` identity. Do not select by filename or apparent newest revision.
2. Install the exact full content of `library_modules/HUB-CAP-AUTHORING_v0.4.md` in that Library root. Do not place it in Project Sources.
3. Open the installed object and read `FULL_FILE`. Verify Module ID, Package ID, Runtime role, Status, Version and material body against the repository artifact. Complete sufficiently scoped listing/search coverage for plausible matches; multiple valid ACTIVE identities or incomplete coverage leaves the binding `UNRESOLVED`. Hidden internal IDs may remain null when the platform does not expose or require them. Do not fabricate `library_file_id`, `library_version_id` or a durable locator.
4. Preserve the currently working Project stack until step 3 succeeds. Then switch Project Sources as one compatible set to `HUB_ROUTER_v1.1.yaml`, `HUB_ARCHITECTURE_v1.4.md` and `HUB_PACKAGE_CATALOG_v1.4.yaml`. Keep `HUB_CI_v1.1.md` unchanged in Project Instructions. Replace the prior Architecture/Catalog authority; do not run both root Catalog revisions simultaneously.
5. Confirm Router pins resolve exactly Architecture 1.4 and Catalog 1.4. Confirm AIS, ImageT, TECHNICAL and Concept Development bindings remain unchanged.
6. Run only S1–S3 below in fresh controlled Central Hub turns. Record exact revisions, model/surface/date, actual Library read evidence, selection, output and blockers. A model claim that it read the module is not retrieval proof.
7. Only after the controlled switch and smoke results are acceptable should the prior deployed stack be retired from active authority. Keep recoverable rollback material, but never as automatic fallback.

## Later live smoke fixtures — NOT RUN

### S1 — positive GENERIC

Copy as one user message:

```text
/AUTHOR GENERIC
Write a concise downstream prompt that asks an assistant to compare two note-taking methods for a personal creative project. Preserve that no method has been selected yet. Return the prompt only; do not execute it.
```

Expected: Authoring is selected, returns a prompt artifact and does not execute it or select a method.

### S2 — positive IMAGET

Copy as one user message:

```text
/AUTHOR IMAGET
Create an image-facing prompt from this frozen concept state: an affluent late-Ming Jiangnan woman's autumn daytime clothing; proposal P remains provisional, option R remains rejected, and collar/combination details remain open unless the supplied evidence and decision authority both permit closure. Preserve open, provisional and rejected state. Do not create or pass a Ready Gate and do not generate an image.
```

Expected: Authoring is selected, preserves decision constraints and state, creates an image-facing prompt, and neither creates/approves a Ready Gate nor generates.

### S3 — negative semantic-intent control

Copy as one user message:

```text
Please help me write a prompt for another assistant that compares two note-taking methods. Do not execute the resulting prompt.
```

Expected: `HUB-PKG-AUTHORING` is not selected merely from prompt-writing intent; normal Hub behavior continues. `PROMPT-AUTHORING INTENT != AUTHORING ACTIVATION`.

## Deliberate rollback — not automatic fallback

If the new active stack fails after manual deployment:

1. Stop Authoring-dependent execution and preserve the failure evidence.
2. Explicitly restore the prior compatible Router snapshot, Architecture 1.3 and root Catalog 1.3 from `Source_archive/Authoring 0.4 promotion 2026-11-01/` into Project Sources as one authority set; keep Hub CI 1.1 unchanged.
3. Restore exact Authoring 0.3 from the archived library_modules artifact only as a deliberate rollback and reverify its identity; remove or disable the promoted 0.4 Library binding from the active deployment, or move it outside the active discovery root using a recoverable platform-supported action.
4. Reverify the restored exact stack and its prior bindings before dependent use.

Do not keep Catalog 1.3 and 1.4 as simultaneous authorities. Library resolution failure never triggers an automatic repository/Project Source/archive substitute.

`ROLLBACK != FALLBACK`

## Provenance

The predecessor Architecture 1.3, Catalog 1.3, pre-pin Router 1.1 snapshot, prior promotion instructions, active 0.3 and 0.4 candidate are preserved byte-exact under `Source_archive/Authoring 0.4 promotion 2026-11-01/` after successor verification. Archived sources are historical/rollback evidence only, never runtime discovery or fallback.
