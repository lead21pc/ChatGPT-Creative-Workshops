# Central Hub Runtime Evidence Changelog

## Purpose and evidence rules

This file preserves runtime-evidence continuity for Central Hub maintenance. It is a repository maintenance/provenance record, not a runtime control, Router, Catalog, deployment manifest, state engine, activation source, Project Source or Library object. It records evidence; it does not create runtime truth or override Hub CI, Router, Architecture, Package Catalog, actual Library state or actual Project deployment.

Repository checks, fixtures and static tests remain separate evidence classes. Before a maintenance task concludes that a material runtime path is `NOT_VERIFIED`, `UNKNOWN` or `NOT_RUN`, inspect the current entries and the chronological log for an applicable, non-superseded result. User-confirmed runtime results are valid provenance when attributed as such; direct tool or UI reproduction must use its own provenance label. New actual evidence controls current status in its affected scope and must be reconciled here without deleting earlier history.

Evidence applies only to the recorded path, scope and revisions. A later material revision needs its own verification. A later failure or replacement may invalidate current applicability for the affected scope; absence of a newer test does not by itself erase a still-applicable result. A recorded result can establish that a path was verified, but cannot substitute for a requested current reproduction.

## Current verified runtime status

### AUTHORING_0_6_REPOSITORY_PROMOTION

- Deployment update 2026-11-02: USER_REPORTED_DEPLOYMENT. The user explicitly confirms Authoring 0.6 deployment. This supersedes pre-deployment planning status for that reported deployment, not production identity or routing evidence. Codex did not perform or independently inspect deployment; exact Library identity/FULL_FILE binding remains NOT_VERIFIED / UNRESOLVED and active 0.6 routing remains NOT_RUN pending a separate result. Supplied-candidate L1/L2 USER_CONFIRMED_LIVE_PASS is unchanged.
- M4 COMPLETE; AUTHORING 0.6 REPOSITORY BASELINE STABLE. Repository promotion IMPLEMENTED: Authoring ACTIVE/0.6, Architecture/Catalog ACTIVE/1.7, CI/Router 1.1. Router contracts pins only changed after explicit authorization; CI and routing algorithm unchanged. Post-promotion static results are recorded in the verification log after execution.
- L1: USER_CONFIRMED_LIVE_PASS / SUPPLIED-CANDIDATE LIVE BEHAVIOR. User reports exact Catalog 1.7-candidate/CANDIDATE and Authoring 0.6-candidate/CANDIDATE, CATALOG_FULL_FILE_READ YES, AUTHORING_FULL_FILE_READ YES, GENERIC/P2. Candidate binding, CONTRACT behavior and relational preservation PASS on a long-running Devil's Advocate operating contract with no preservation checklist. Preserved authority ownership, cross-turn state, goal/means, objection lifecycle and retirement/reopening conditions, proposal/decision, factual-state boundaries, hypothetical/established limitations, complexity distinctions, pacing and stop conditions. Objection -> user response -> resolved/narrowed/open state remained linked; resolved objections stayed retired and new objections remained new issues.
- L2: USER_CONFIRMED_LIVE_PASS / SUPPLIED-CANDIDATE LIVE BEHAVIOR. Same reported candidate identities and FULL_FILE receipts in a fresh supplied-control chat, GENERIC/NO PRESET; candidate binding and no-preset regression PASS. No preset was required, inferred or demanded. PRESET SUPPORT != PRESET REQUIREMENT.
- Recording date: 2026-11-02; exact run dates/model and raw source/output/read traces were not supplied. Codex did not independently reproduce these smokes. Actual smoke source differs from the planned synthetic campaign fixture; no claim that that fixture was run. Candidate static T0–T3 remain LOCAL SPEC SIMULATION / REVIEWED_TEXT.
- SUPPLIED-CANDIDATE LIVE BEHAVIOR != ACTIVE HUB ROUTING. Active 0.6 routing NOT_RUN; production Library identity/FULL_FILE binding NOT_VERIFIED / UNRESOLVED; 0.6 installation/Project deployment NOT_PERFORMED by this task. No active Library object IDs inferred. REPOSITORY BASELINE STABLE != ACTIVE CENTRAL HUB RUNTIME VERIFIED. Existing scoped 0.5 PASS/deployment evidence remains historical in its original scope; M1/M2/M3 are not reopened.

### AUTHORING_0_6_M4_PRESET_CANDIDATE

- Historical candidate implementation snapshot: the NOT_RUN and production-0.5 statements below describe the implementation point. Supplied-candidate L1/L2 and later repository promotion are recorded above; the original synthetic fixture is not claimed executed.
- Repository-only CANDIDATE / 0.6-candidate, with test-only Root Catalog 1.7-candidate. Production remains ACTIVE 0.5 / Architecture-Catalog 1.6 / Hub CI-Router 1.1. M4 is explicitly reopened for optional P1/CLEAN, P2/CONTRACT and P3/REBUILD; M1/M2/M3 closure and scoped 0.5 PASS/deployment evidence remain unchanged.
- Static/spec checks and T0–T3 fixed reference transformations are not live model compliance. Candidate L1/L2: NOT_RUN; candidate installation/deployment/promotion: NOT_PERFORMED. No new Library identity or FULL_FILE evidence. See candidates/authoring_m4/AUTHORING_M4_TESTS.md for exact later supplied-control smoke inputs and evidence limits.

### AUTHORING_0_5_STABLE_M3

- Historical 0.5 baseline after 0.6 repository promotion; all reported 0.5 results and deployment attribution below retain their original scope.
- Deployment: USER_REPORTED_DEPLOYMENT for the current Authoring 0.5 / Architecture-Catalog 1.6 / Hub CI-Router 1.1 stack, confirmed by the user on 2026-11-01. Codex did not perform deployment. This supersedes implementation-time NOT_PERFORMED status for the reported deployment; exact Library object identity, FULL_FILE/header/body verification and binding resolution remain unverified. Existing scoped live PASS is retained without a rerun requirement.
- STATUS: ACTIVE / CURRENT STABLE BASELINE. Repository: ACTIVE; static verification: PASS. M1 CLOSED and M2 CLOSED for the current bounded needs. No current observed failure requires further Authoring architecture work.
- User-confirmed actual Central Hub results: C1 explicit AIS + CREATIVE composition PASS; C1 composed prompt-to-execution round-trip PASS; C2 material ambiguity clarification PASS; C3 original /AUTHOR AIS single-target PASS. Classification for each: USER_CONFIRMED_LIVE_PASS. Codex did not run or independently reproduce these cases.
- C1 preserved the fictional premise, open design state, Creative proposals as proposals and research evidence as evidence, without design acceptance or authority merge. Execution retained the composed specification and stopped at open questions. C2 asked one focused relationship question without guessed priority. C3 used the single-target path without contributor loading, composition clarification or fabricated prior findings.
- Runtime identity: repository exact stack VERIFIED (Hub CI/Router 1.1, Architecture/Catalog 1.6, Authoring 0.5). Actual Central Hub environment and intended 0.5 stack are USER_REPORTED. No exact installation receipt, FULL_FILE/header/body retrieval trace, bound Library object identity or raw case outputs were supplied for independent identity verification. Runtime identity remains PARTIALLY ESTABLISHED / EXACT IDENTITY UNRESOLVED; this does not erase the reported LIVE BEHAVIOR PASS. Do not mark Catalog Library IDs/resolution verified from this behavioral report.
- M1 closure basis: prior user-confirmed 0.4 T1 Execution, T2 Rewrite and T2 Reauthor PASS retained in original scope; provenance correction is implemented and preserved in 0.5, and the reported 0.5 C3 exhibits no fabricated prior findings. This is bounded closure, not a claim that the separate 0.4.1 packet was rerun or every M1 path was retested on 0.5.
- Known composition scope: one output target plus one supported contributor. Live scope covers AIS + CREATIVE only and one composed round-trip. It does not establish every target/contributor pair, arbitrary N-way composition, all downstream surfaces or general Router correctness.
- BRAINSTORM: contract/static support exists; dedicated live result NOT_ESTABLISHED; dedicated smoke is not required for M3 closure. Future real use may supply evidence IF NEEDED, with no roadmap commitment.
- Earlier outside-chat manual injection remains EXPLORATORY only. Prior revision and implementation-time NOT_RUN/NOT_PERFORMED entries below are historical and superseded for the reported 0.5 behaviors, not deleted. No deployment was performed by Codex during M3.

### AUTHORING_0_5_M2 — implementation-time snapshot

- REPOSITORY ACTIVE / IMPLEMENTED / STATICALLY_VERIFIED; explicit active authorization during M2. Authoring 0.5, Architecture/Catalog 1.6, Router 1.1 pins. No Router algorithm, Hub CI or Concept leaf behavior change.
- Library installation NOT_PERFORMED; identity/FULL_FILE binding UNRESOLVED / NOT_VERIFIED. C1/C2/C3 and composed execution smoke NOT_RUN. Prior M1 PASS stays scoped to 0.4; no new live PASS inferred. Corrective provenance contract retained; its own live regression still NOT_RUN.


### AUTHORING_0_4_1_CONTEXT_PROVENANCE_CORRECTION

- Repository: ACTIVE / IMPLEMENTED / STATICALLY VERIFIED; Authoring 0.4.1, Architecture/Catalog 1.5, Router 1.1 pins.
- New revision installation: NOT_PERFORMED by Codex; identity/FULL_FILE binding: UNRESOLVED / NOT_VERIFIED. Corrected Author live regression: NOT_RUN.
- Prior actual Central Hub 0.4 evidence (user-confirmed, not independently reproduced): T1 Author OBSERVED LIVE CENTRAL HUB FAILURE, narrow context-provenance contamination; T1 Execution USER_CONFIRMED_LIVE_PASS; T2 Rewrite USER_CONFIRMED_LIVE_PASS; T2 Reauthor USER_CONFIRMED_LIVE_PASS. No complete source/input/output/retrieval trace supplied.
- Those reported 0.4 stages supersede the earlier NOT_RUN record below; PASS applies only to its stated path/revision, not globally or automatically to 0.4.1. M2 NOT STARTED.


### AUTHORING_0_4_REPOSITORY_PROMOTION

- Status: REPOSITORY ACTIVE / IMPLEMENTED / STATICALLY VERIFIED; Authoring 0.4 with Architecture/Catalog 1.4 and Router 1.1 pins.
- Library installation: NOT_PERFORMED; identity/FULL_FILE binding: UNRESOLVED / NOT_VERIFIED; Project deployment: NOT_PERFORMED; Central Hub live T1/T2 and round-trip verification: NOT_RUN.
- User reports outside-chat manual candidate T1/T2 testing. Classification: EXPLORATORY MANUAL-CANDIDATE EVIDENCE; no per-stage results/traces supplied here. NOT CENTRAL HUB RUNTIME EVIDENCE. It establishes neither active acceptance nor demonstrated active failure.
- Prior 0.3 evidence remains historical in its recorded scope. M2 NOT STARTED.


### IMAGET_OPEN_GATE_1_2_REPOSITORY_PROMOTION

- Status: `REPOSITORY_ACTIVE / STATICALLY_VERIFIED`; controller 1.2, manifest 2.2.0, Architecture/Catalog 1.3 and Router 1.1 exact pins.
- Static baseline: `159/159 PASS`; post-promotion static suite: `159/159 PASS`.
- Candidate bounded smoke: `USER-PROVIDED LIVE CANDIDATE EVIDENCE / USER_CONFIRMED_LIVE_PASS`; controller 1.2-candidate. T01 RAW construction, T02 semantic preservation, T03 no appearance-based preservation inference, T04 exact PALETTE ONLY reference binding: PASS. No observed regression was reported in those paths. Codex did not independently reproduce these runs; original traces were not supplied in this task.
- Project deployment: `NOT PERFORMED`; active integrated runtime smoke: `NOT RUN`. Candidate evidence does not establish active integrated runtime verification or global ImageT correctness.
- Predecessor controller SHA-256: `6d33c80f4852c1b44c32abf6e898c14e8f001d24796d406aafc49a95ab3a2733`; retained byte-exact in `Source_archive/ImageT Open Gate promotion 2026-10-29/` with the tested candidate and prior binding snapshots.

### AUTHORING_0_3_REPOSITORY_PROMOTION

- Status: `REPOSITORY_IMPLEMENTED / STATICALLY_VERIFIED`; not a runtime PASS.
- Scope: `HUB-CAP-AUTHORING / HUB-PKG-AUTHORING / CAPABILITY / ACTIVE / 0.3`, Architecture/Catalog 1.2 and Router 1.1 exact-pin update.
- Library installation: `NOT_PERFORMED`; Library binding/FULL_FILE identity: `NOT_VERIFIED / UNRESOLVED`.
- Project deployment: `NOT_PERFORMED`; promoted live routing and S1-S3: `NOT_RUN`.
- Prior Hanfu B/C and `/AUTHOR IMAGET` candidate results remain candidate behavioral evidence; they do not become promoted-runtime evidence.

### HANFU_SHORT_REAL_CONTEXT_REGRESSION_PASS

- Status: `USER_CONFIRMED_LIVE_PASS`; Authoring v0.3 candidate, short Hanfu context, arms B and C only.
- B: PASS for preserving decision constraints and unresolved/provisional/rejected state. C: PASS for keeping evidence support separate from selection and finalization authority.
- C used a frozen synthetic AIS evidence packet; no live AIS research or downstream execution. Codex did not independently reproduce the run.
- Does not establish global Authoring, target-matrix, AIS integration, downstream execution, production readiness or promotion.

### INTEGRATED_RUNTIME_SMOKE_2026_10_27

- Status: `USER_CONFIRMED_LIVE_PASS`
- Scope: One integrated Central Hub execution across AIS, TECHNICAL and `HUB-PKG-CONCEPT-DEVELOPMENT`, with BRAINSTORM and CREATIVE selected for their scoped contributions.
- Runtime/package/artifacts: Hub CI 1.1; Hub Router 1.1; Architecture/Catalog 1.1; AIS pipeline 1.1 with router 1.2; `HUB-DOM-TECHNICAL` 1.0; `HUB-DOM-CONCEPT-DEVELOPMENT` 1.0; `HUB-CAP-BRAINSTORM` 1.1; `HUB-DOM-CREATIVE` 1.1.
- Evidence type: User-confirmed result from actual Central Hub runtime execution; Codex did not independently reproduce the run.
- Confirmed: AIS external research; TECHNICAL mechanism conditions and failure modes; BRAINSTORM premise variation, parallel branches and second-order consequences; CREATIVE functional fictional realization; concept-core causal propagation and provisional branch status; Hub separation between research and fictional design, and between branch realization and canon acceptance.
- Last confirmed: 2026-10-27.
- Applies to: The integrated smoke path and exact artifact revisions listed above.
- Does not prove: Every internal retrieval call or `FULL_FILE` trace; all C01-C12 cases; unrelated packages or pipelines; all Central Hub runtime behavior; future revisions; current reproduction after a material runtime change.
- Related log entry: `2026-10-27 - Integrated concept-development runtime smoke`.

## Verification log

### 2026-11-02 - User confirms Authoring 0.6 deployment

- User clarifies that Authoring 0.6 is already deployed and requests recording it. Classification: USER_REPORTED_DEPLOYMENT; recording date is 2026-11-02, exact deployment time/read receipts were not supplied. Codex did not deploy or reproduce active routing. Production identity/FULL_FILE stays NOT_VERIFIED / UNRESOLVED; active routing stays NOT_RUN; candidate L1/L2 PASS is retained in its original scope.

### 2026-11-02 - Authoring 0.6 promotion and supplied-candidate smoke receipts

- Post-promotion static verification: focused Authoring 25/25 PASS; full Hub 194/194 PASS. Three new promotion tests account for the increase from 22/191: promoted identity and exact candidate-body preservation, archive/minimum binding delta, and scoped evidence separation. Preset syntax, T0–T3 fixed fixtures, no-preset and existing composition checks pass. YAML/pins/unique active revisions and predecessor hashes pass. These are repository/static checks, not active runtime reproduction.
- User explicitly approved promotion and later main switch/fast-forward and minimum Architecture/Router pin updates. The main baseline is f363546, equivalent to ca70b28; no FTH-private commit is included. Recorded L1/L2 as USER_CONFIRMED_LIVE_PASS with supplied-candidate scope and user-reported FULL_FILE receipts, not independently reproduced production reads.
- Promoted the unchanged preset contract to ACTIVE/0.6 and Catalog 1.7, minimally advanced Architecture and Router pins, and preserved all predecessors/tested controls byte-exact under Source_archive/Authoring 0.6 promotion 2026-11-02/. No push, tag, Library/Project deployment or CURRENT update. Active Hub routing remains NOT_RUN and production identity NOT_VERIFIED.

### 2026-11-02 - Authoring M4 preset candidate prepared

- Added an isolated inline-preset candidate and test-only root admission metadata, preserving the complete production stack byte-exact. T0–T3 use LOCAL SPEC SIMULATION / REVIEWED_TEXT plus fixed-artifact checks; they do not establish live behavior. L1/L2 remain NOT_RUN. No promotion, Project/Library mutation, deployment or push; existing user-confirmed 0.5 evidence retains its scope.

### 2026-11-01 - User confirms Authoring 0.5 deployment

- User explicitly reports deployment of the current stack and requests publication of the repository records. Classification: USER_REPORTED_DEPLOYMENT; no independent Codex deployment or exact FULL_FILE/Library identity receipt supplied. Recording date is 2026-11-01; exact deployment time was not supplied.
- C1/C2/C3 and composed round-trip USER_CONFIRMED_LIVE_PASS remain unchanged. No new behavior, live rerun or milestone is implied.

### 2026-11-01 - Authoring M3 stabilize and close

- User reports actual Central Hub C1 composition PASS, C1 composed round-trip PASS, C2 ambiguity PASS and C3 single-target/provenance regression PASS. USER_CONFIRMED_LIVE_PASS; result summary supplied by the user, no raw outputs or FULL_FILE identity receipts independently inspected. Date is recording date; exact model/run time were not supplied.
- Repository stack verified as Authoring 0.5, Architecture/Catalog 1.6, Hub CI/Router 1.1. Runtime identity remains partial/unresolved as documented above; no fabricated installation or retrieval evidence.
- Current M1/M2 needs CLOSED; AUTHORING 0.5 STABLE BASELINE. Prior PASS scopes and exploratory history retained. No behavior change, new feature, deployment, extra live case or M4.


### 2026-11-01 - Authoring M2 active repository implementation

- User changed M2 authorization from candidate to ACTIVE 0.5. Bounded two-part target/contributor syntax and scoped supplied-contribution composition added; active Catalog admission and Router pins reconciled.
- Preserved 0.4.1 and compatible prior stack byte-exact. Prepared only C1–C3 plus C1 round-trip smoke. No Library/Project deployment or live tests executed by Codex.


### 2026-11-01 - Actual Central Hub M1 results and provenance correction

- User confirms live Central Hub 0.4: T1 Author narrow FAIL; T1 Execution PASS; T2 Rewrite PASS; T2 Reauthor PASS. Date is recording date; exact run time/model were not supplied. Distinct from earlier outside-chat exploratory tests.
- T1 context named Obsidian/Logseq, local-first constraints, rejected Notion, open plugin ecosystem and closure condition. Authoring retained these but invented prior-round findings about product/storage/development state. Calling unsupplied claims hypotheses did not establish provenance.
- Corrective 0.4.1 separates supplied context, Hub state, grounded evidence, generated structure and model knowledge; neutral questions are allowed, invented source history is not. Prior PASS stages are not reopened. New live regression remains NOT_RUN.


### 2026-11-01 - Authoring 0.4 repository promotion

- Promoted M1 candidate through status/admission wording only; five targets, explicit context, rewrite and reauthor retained. Archived active 0.3, candidate and compatible prior stack byte-exact.
- Router exact pins updated; no Hub CI or unrelated package behavior change. Runtime installation and actual Central Hub tests remain pending; see AUTHORING_PROMOTION.md.
- MANUAL CANDIDATE INJECTION != CENTRAL HUB RUNTIME VERIFICATION.


### 2026-10-29 - ImageT Open Gate repository promotion

- Promoted tested controller 1.2-candidate to ACTIVE 1.2 through status/version and runtime source-selection cleanup only; retained Open Gate semantic behavior. Updated manifest and root Catalog binding together, with Architecture/Catalog 1.3 pins in Router 1.1; Hub CI and Router algorithm unchanged.
- Focused Open Gate/ImageT checks and full static suite passed; full suite before/after: 159/159. Archived predecessor/candidate/binding snapshots byte-exact. T01-T04 PASS is user-provided live candidate evidence only.
- No Project deployment, Library upload, active integrated live test, stage, commit or push was performed.

### 2026-10-28 - Authoring 0.3 repository promotion

- Evidence status: repository implementation and static verification only.
- Added the active Authoring singleton artifact and root Catalog admission with the exact six-trigger boundary; revised shared topology and compatible Router pins without changing Hub CI or Router selection algorithm.
- Prepared manual Library/Project switch, S1-S3 live fixtures and deliberate rollback instructions in `AUTHORING_PROMOTION.md`; none were executed.
- `REPOSITORY PROMOTION != LIBRARY INSTALLATION != PROJECT DEPLOYMENT != LIVE ROUTING`.

### 2026-10-28 - Hanfu short Authoring regression

- Evidence status: `USER_CONFIRMED_LIVE_PASS`, B and C for the two reported v0.2 failure mechanisms, in the short v0.3 Hanfu context.
- B preserved state and decision constraints. C preserved qualified synthetic E1–E7 evidence, unresolved combinations and decision authority; no unsupported selection or acceptance.
- No live AIS research or downstream target execution. User-provided result; no independent Codex reproduction. Date is recording date; actual run date was not supplied.
- REGRESSION PASS != GLOBAL AUTHORING VERIFICATION; SYNTHETIC EVIDENCE FIXTURE != LIVE AIS INTEGRATION; PROMPT ARTIFACT PASS != DOWNSTREAM EXECUTION PASS.

### 2026-10-27 - Integrated concept-development runtime smoke

- Evidence status: `USER_CONFIRMED_LIVE_PASS`
- Runtime context: Central Hub Project; AIS pipeline 1.1/router 1.2; TECHNICAL 1.0; Concept Development core 1.0; BRAINSTORM 1.1; CREATIVE 1.1.
- Test intent: Exercise external evidence research, technical mechanism analysis, premise variation and parallel branches, second-order consequences, functional fictional realization, and preservation of provisional state across one integrated path.
- Observed result: AIS executed external research. TECHNICAL analyzed operating conditions and failure modes. BRAINSTORM produced distinct premise variants, parallel branches and second-order effects. CREATIVE realized the branches through functional fictional material. Concept Development preserved causal propagation and provisional branch status. Research remained distinct from fictional design, and branch realization did not become canon acceptance.
- Result: `PASS` for the stated integrated path.
- Evidence provenance: User confirmed a runtime PASS from actual Central Hub execution on 2026-10-27. Codex did not independently reproduce the run and no complete internal retrieval trace was supplied.
- Does not independently prove: Every internal retrieval or `FULL_FILE` event; all C01-C12 cases; unrelated packages/pipelines; future revisions; a global Central Hub PASS.

## Superseded / invalidated evidence

None recorded. When a later result supersedes or invalidates current applicability, retain the original log entry, update the current-status entry for the affected scope and append the newer evidence here or in the verification log with its exact scope and provenance.
